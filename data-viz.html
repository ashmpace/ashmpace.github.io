		<p>Created with Python and plotly, these figures illustrate the risk of automation to various U.S. industries across states. A value of one means a risk equal with that of the national average, a value of two, twice the national average, etc. These 'location quotients' were calculated using probabilities from the McKinsey Global Institute and occupational data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
